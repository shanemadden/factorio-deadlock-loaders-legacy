Version: 1.7.3
Date: 08. 03. 2019

Version: 1.7.2
Date: 02. 03. 2019
  Changes:
    - Updated for migration to new combined mod, please download the new required dependency Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders, as well as Deadlock-Mod Integrations if you use third-party mod support.
    - Please see the mod portal for more detailed migration instructions - load the updated version of this migration mod at least once with all saves that have loaders to avoid losing them!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.0
Date: 08. 05. 2018
  Changes:
    - Final "definitive" version for Factorio 0.16.
    - Another check added to belt snapping, courtesy of shanemadden.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.6

  Inter-mod support:
    - Factorio base 0.16.36 (0.16 stable) is now the minimum requirement.

Version: 1.5.5
Date: 04. 05. 2018
  Changes:
    - The map/minimap colour for compact loaders now defaults to the same as vanilla loaders (dull blue).
    - As an alternative, a new config setting has been provided, off by default. Belts, splitters, undergrounds, compact loaders and stacking beltboxes appear on maps with various shades of the respective belt tier's colour.
    - Maps in existing save games won't update until the chunk is re-charted (by radar, by building in the chunk, or with the command).
    - Note to translators: there is a new config option, nothing else has changed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.4
Date: 25. 04. 2018
  Changes:
    - Snapping improved, takes cues from adjacent belts when setting input/output mode (code by shanemadden).
    - Snapping settings changed. Former snap-to-inventory settings merged. New belt snapping has a new setting.
    - Entity description informs newbies about input/output mode rotation.
    - Note to translators: entity description and settings labels and descriptions have changed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.3
Date: 06. 04. 2018
  Bugfixes:
    - Loader snapping repaired after a recent breaking change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.2
Date: 05. 04. 2018
  Bugfixes:
    - If mod support specifies items which don't exist today, the tier creation is skipped and logged rather than halting the loading process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.1
Date: 04. 04. 2018
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed handling of default underground->loader recipe gen when multiple difficulties are defined unusually by other mods (AAI Industry).
    - Fixed a typo in FactorioExtended support (tier 5 splitter).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.0
Date: 04. 04. 2018
  Inter-mod support:
    - Added a "public" function for other modders. Now you can easily add or change loader tiers yourself. See the documentation pdf in the zipfile for details.
    - Added tier 0 loaders to Xander Mod and Bob's Logistics.
    - Belt icons are now themed when belt style is on.
    - Factorio-Extended-Plus (a fork of Factorio-Extended) is now supported.
  Changes:
    - Mall-breaking change, apologies: by default, loaders now derive their recipes from the same tier's underneathies. This can be overridden by other mods if they want.
    - Removed loader research. Loaders are now unlocked by the Logistics technology chain.
    - There was some internal renaming. Your saves will be migrated.
    - Vanilla 1x2 loaders are no longer styled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.1
Date: 30. 03. 2018
  Changes:
    - Swapped Bob's Logistics tier colours around. BL 0.16.17 is now required.
    - Added a deferred check for altered vanilla belt speeds to catch updates in other mods.
    - Added theme support for tier 0 belts etc. in Xander Mod and Bob's Logistics.
    - Did not add tier 0 loaders. No point.
    - Added per-mod localised names.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 28. 03. 2018
  Changes:
    - Made the internal structure of the mod properly modular, reducing variable/function scope.
    - Added Paradox Mode. This is Compact Loaders without loaders, but allows you to keep the belt styling if that's all you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 24. 03. 2018
  Changes:
    - An optional new theme for belts is available. It is off by default: go to Options > Mod Settings to activate it.
    - The theme uses the same two layers for all belts across the rainbow, saving VRAM for belt sprites (by as much as 60% if extra tiers are enabled for other mods).
    - However it also increases rendering time slightly, so YMMV: it might help or hinder or neither, depending on your PC's capabilities. Anyway, they look pretty.
    - Shrunk the loader's collision box, by popular request.
  Inter-mod support:
    - The belt theme overrides modded belts as well, making them look consistent and providing high-res versions if none existed previously.
    - If the belt theme is off, loaders and underneathies get their belt sprites automatically from modded belt prototypes, instead of assuming the filenames.
    - Loaders now automatically look up their speed from the corresponding belt prototype, instead of assuming vanilla speed progression.
    - Added support for Xander Mod tier 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.6
Date: 02. 03. 2018
  Inter-mod support:
    - Look for "revive" flag passed by Nanobots in on_entity_built and cancel snapping.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 12. 02. 2018

Date: 06. 02. 2018

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 05. 02. 2018
  Changes:
    - Loader sprites and icons reworked. They are now separated into layers and masks, saving VRAM and allowing for any dynamic colour without needing new sprites.
    - Tier 4 and 5 loaders become available if Factorio Extended (Transport) is active (and if you can get it to load).
